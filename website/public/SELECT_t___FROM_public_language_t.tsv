6	37cea6eb-10a9-459d-8db1-4b1e7d48e563	Typescript	TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.	"TypeScript is an open-source object-oriented language developed and maintained by Microsoft, licensed under Apache 2 license. It is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript was developed under Anders Hejlsberg, who also led the creation of the C# language. TypeScript was first released in October 2012.

JavaScript has seen a vast development in the last few years. It is the most versatile cross-platform language that is used to develop modern web applications. It can be used to develop both the client side of an application, with frameworks like Angular or React.js, as well as the server side, with frameworks such as Node.js. It is now being considered the most opted for language to build end-to-end applications. But, JavaScript was never meant for such large-scale application development. JavaScript is a dynamic programming language with no type system, unlike well-structured and refined languages such as C# or Java. A no type system means that a variable in JavaScript can have any type of value such as string, number, boolean etc. The type system increases the code quality, readability and makes it an easy to maintain and refactor code base. More importantly, errors can be caught at compile time rather than at run time.

Without the type system, it is difficult to scale JavaScript to build complex applications with large teams working on the same code.

Hence, the reason to use TypeScript is that it allows JavaScript to be used at scale.

TypeScript compiles into simple JavaScript. The TypeScript compiler is also implemented in TypeScript and can be used with any browser or JavaScript engines like Node.js. TypeScript needs an ECMAScript 3 or higher compatible environment to compile. This is a condition met by all browsers and JavaScript engines today.

Some of the most popular JavaScript frameworks like Angular.js and WinJS are written in TypeScript."
2	50c2e9c1-c9e8-4e8c-8eaa-50524bc619ff	Javascript	JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages.	"JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.

Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design."

Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript or native code (via LLVM). Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.	"Kotlin is a general purpose, free, open source, statically typed “pragmatic” programming language initially designed for the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and Android that combines object-oriented and functional programming features. It is focused on interoperability, safety, clarity, and tooling support. Versions of Kotlin targeting JavaScript ES5.1 and native code (using LLVM) for a number of processors are in production as well.

Kotlin originated at JetBrains, the company behind IntelliJ IDEA, in 2010, and has been open source since 2012. The Kotlin team currently has more than 90 full-time members from JetBrains, and the Kotlin project on GitHub has more than 300 contributors. JetBrains uses Kotlin in many of its products including its flagship IntelliJ IDEA.

Allowing top-level functions is just the beginning of the functional programming story for Kotlin. The language also supports higher-order functions, anonymous functions, lambdas, inline functions, closures, tail recursion, and generics. In other words, Kotlin has all of the features and advantages of a functional language."

Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development.	"Python is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language similar to PERL, that has gained popularity because of its clear syntax and readability. Python is said to be relatively easy to learn and portable, meaning its statements can be interpreted in a number of operating systems, including UNIX-based systems, Mac OS, MS-DOS, OS/2, and various versions of Microsoft Windows 98. Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a former resident of the Netherlands, whose favorite comedy group at the time was Monty Python's Flying Circus. The source code is freely available and open for modification and reuse. Python has a significant number of users.

A notable feature of Python is its indenting of source statements to make the code easier to read. Python offers dynamic data type, ready-made class, and interfaces to many system calls and libraries. It can be extended, using the C or C++ language.

Python can be used as the script in Microsoft's Active Server Page (ASP) technology. The scoreboard system for the Melbourne (Australia) Cricket Ground is written in Python. Z Object Publishing Environment, a popular Web application server, is also written in the Python language."
4	ea8e0c45-677b-4824-8d9b-b081163c776c	Java	Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.	"ava is a widely used programming language expressly designed for use in the distributed environment of the internet. It is the most popular programming language for Android smartphone applications and is also among the most favored for the development of edge devices and the internet of things.

Java was designed to have the look and feel of the C++ programming language, but is simpler to use and enforces an object-oriented programming model. Java can be used to create complete applications that may run on a single computer or be distributed among servers and clients in a network. It can also be used to build a small application module or applet for use as part of a webpage.

It is easy for developers to write programs which employ popular software design patterns and best practices using the various components found in Java EE. For example, frameworks such as Struts and JavaServer Faces all use a Java servlet to implement the front controller design pattern for centralizing requests.
 
 A big part of the Java ecosystem is the large variety of open source and community built projects, software platforms and APIs. For example, the Apache Foundation hosts a variety of projects written using Java, including simple logging frameworks for Java (SLF4J), both Yarn and Hadoop processing frameworks, Microservices development platforms and integration platforms.
 
 Java EE environments can be used in the cloud as well. Developers can build, deploy, debug and monitor Java applications on Google Cloud at a scalable level.
 
 In terms of mobile development, Java is commonly used as the programming language for Android applications. Java tends to be preferred by Android developers because of Java’s security, object-oriented paradigms, regularly updated and maintained feature sets, use of JVM and frameworks for networking, IO and threading.
 
 Although Java is widely used, it still has fair criticisms. Java syntax is often criticized for being too verbose. In response, several peripheral languages have emerged to address these issues, including Groovy. Due to the way Java references objects internally, complex and concurrent list-based operations slow the JVM. The Scala language addresses many of the shortcomings of the Java language that reduce its ability to scale."
